# Recipe API + UI

As a world famous chef turned programmer, you want to create an app with a UI and API where people can create and view their favorite recipes.


### UI

The UI should support the following operations:

1. Input form for adding a new recipe
2. A recipe list that allows you to select a recipe to view
3. Recipe items in the list should state the name and a delete button that deletes a recipe
4. A view panel to show the details of the recipe


### UI
- Use React or Angular to build the UI (create-react-app or create-next-app are great kickstart options)
- The UI must communicate to the API
- All features should work as expected
- Unit tests are welcome, but not required for assessment
